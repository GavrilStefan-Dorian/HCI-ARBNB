            <h2>Persona Story: Ethan Carter, The Tech-Savvy Traveler</h2>
            <p>Ethan Carter is not your typical tourist. As a freelance travel blogger, he takes pride in discovering unique stays and sharing his experiences with his audience. Every trip is an adventure, and every rental is a story waiting to be told. But Ethan doesn’t just book blindly—he does his homework.</p>
            <p>Before finalizing any booking, Ethan fires up his favorite travel app. Using the mobile interface, he checks real-time stats, price fluctuations, and guest reviews. He enjoys filtering properties based on detailed analytics rather than vague descriptions.</p>
            <p>Upon arrival at his destination, Ethan doesn’t waste time searching for keys or figuring out complicated European coffee machines. His phone’s AR overlay guides him straight to the lockbox and provides step-by-step instructions for using the appliances. This seamless experience allows him to focus on what truly matters—enjoying his travels and sharing them with the world.</p>
            <p>For Ethan, this isn’t just an app—it’s his ultimate travel companion.</p>
