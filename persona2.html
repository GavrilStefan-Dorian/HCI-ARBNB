            <h2>Persona Story: David Park, The Road Warrior</h2>
            <p>David Park lives out of a suitcase more than he lives at home. As a senior consultant at Global Solutions, he's on the road 3 weeks out of every month, hopping between client sites across the country. While his colleagues tolerate hotels, David has discovered the advantages of residential rentals—when he can find the right ones.</p>
            <p>The mobile app has become David's secret weapon. Before each assignment, he scans available properties using the "Business Ready" filter, which guarantees certain amenities: fast WiFi, a proper workspace, and quiet surroundings.</p>
            <p>What David appreciates most are the time-saving AR features. After long days in client meetings, the last thing he wants is to struggle with a complicated thermostat or entertainment system. A quick scan with his phone reveals simple instructions, letting him focus on preparing for the next day's meetings.</p>
            <p>For David, the app isn't about exploration—it's about eliminating variables in his already unpredictable travel schedule. The confidence of knowing exactly what he's getting allows him to perform at his best, no matter what city he wakes up in.</p>
